# This is our manually-curated lists of requirements.  We've locked
# some of the versions to ensure that we get the same results when
# running the tests on different machines.
#
# This is more complete than the install_requires list used by setup.py for
# the package (which only contains the bare minimal dependencies required
# by LEAP's core features).
