# LEAP CHANGES BY VERSION

Being a terse compilation by version of changes.


## 0.9dev, in progress

 * API changes
   * Remove `expected_num_mutations` from `segmented_rep.ops.apply_mutation()`; mutation rates should now be set directly on nested operators
   * Mutation operators that take an `expected_num_mutations` now give a clear error message if this is greater than the genome size


## 0.8.1, 10/10/2023

 * New Features
   * Added asynchronous NSGA-II, which is in `leap_ec.distrib.asynchronous`; 
     note that the API may change in the future

 * API changes
   * Added `CGPDecoder.initialize()` method for convenience, offering a default genome initializer
   * Replaced `n_ary_crossover` and `uniform_crossover` functions with classes `NAryCrossover` and `UniformCrossover`
   * Added a `persist_children` flag to crossover operators, which allows offspring pairs
   to be used with steady-state algorithms
   * Added a `uuid` field to the `Individual` base class, and `Individual` now also tracks parent & offspring UUIDs; this
     moved UUID support from `DistributedIndividual`
   * Added a `parents` attribute to `Individual` base class that tracks the 
     UUIDs of the parents via clone or crossover
   * Improved auto-scaling of axes for `PopulationMetricsPlotProbe` and `FitnessPlotProbe`
   * standardized on parameter name `bounds` for mutation operators; previously was inconsistent nomenclature between
     `hard_bounds` and `bounds`
   * Made improvements to ReadTheDocs documentation.

    * Mutation operators no longer have default mutation rates (they must be explicitly set by the user).
    * Set default `p_swap = 0.2` for `uniform_crossover`, instead of 0.5
    * Set default `num_points = 2` for `n_ary_crossover`, instead of 1
    * Set default value for `context` parameter on probes, so users needn't set it
    * standardized on making `context` last function argument that defaults to
    `leap_ec.context.context`

        * `Decoder` now in `decoder.py`
    * documentation, doctests, examples, Jupyter notebooks, and unit tests updated accordingly
