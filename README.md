A general purpose Library for Evolutionary Algorithms in Python.
Written by Dr. Jeffrey K. Bassett
Contributors: Dr. R. Paul Weigand

Much of the library was design based on the general description of
Evolutionary Algorithms from Dr. Kenneth A. De Jong's book "Evolutionary
Computation: A Unified Approach".  He was my Ph.D. advisor, so I am quite
familiar with his approach.

As of 9/29/2018:
I wouldn't exactly call this stable just yet, but anyone is free to use it if
they wish.  The current license is GPL v2, but I'm likely to change that to
something that is more permissive and more academic (the MIT license?) at some
point in the future.

I wrote this library while I was working on my dissertation some years back.
I had always thought to release it, but never actually did.  As I look over
the code now, I see that there are some pieces that I'm not completely happy
with.  It's clear that I was learning Python at the same time that I wrote
much of this.

I just upgraded the core parst of the library to Python 3.  I believe that
everything at the top level should work in Python 2 or Python 3.  I wouldn't
trust anything in the sub-modules just yet though.

I'm also not completely happy with the current organization.  I may be
be making some significant changes in the near future.
