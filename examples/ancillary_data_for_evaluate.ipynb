    "\n",
    "For example, each `leap_ec.distributed.individual.DistributedIndividual` supports adding a UUID for each newly created individual.  This UUID string can be used to create a file or subdirectory name that can be later associated with that individual.  For example, a deep-learner model can use that as a file name, or a file containing frames for a driving animation can be stored in a subdirectory that uses that UUID as a name.  However, `Problem.evaluate()` has no direct support for passing that UUID to support either of those scenarios, or any other similar ancillary information.\n",

    "The next approach entails extending the `phenome`, itself, to contain the desired ancillary data.  That is, `Problem.evalute()` accepts a `phenome` parameter, not a `genome` as happens with other, extand EA toolkits, and we can piggyback that ancillary data in the phenome. During the evaluation an individual's genome is decoded into a phenome meaningful to a given `Problem` instance.  Of course for representations that are already phenotypic, such as real-valued vectors, the decoder can be `IdentifyDecoder` that just faithfully passes along the `genome` as the `phenome` without change.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though there is generally a one-to-one mapping between the genome and phenome, it needn't be that way.  That is, the phenotypic space can contain information not found in the genome.  For example, alleles will dictate our hair color, but we can still dye hair a different color.  So, extending the phenome to include additional information is a more \"evolutionary correct\" approach to using ancillary information.\n",
