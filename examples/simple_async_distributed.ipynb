Under the hood it essentially does everything above, plus a few other things, such as allowing you to decide if non-viable individuals count towards the birth budget, or not.  You can also specify the strategy for inserting new individuals into the bag.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A note about non-viable individuals\n",
    "\n",
    "A non-viable individual is one that didn't get a chance to get evaluated because, say, an exception was thrown during the evaluation process.  For example, if you were tuning deep-learner (DL) hyper-parameters, it may be that a given DL configuration an individual represents doesn't make sense such that it caused pytorch or tensorflow to throw an exception.  That individual would be \"non-viable\" because the corresponding DL hyper-parameter set didn't even get a chance to be trained.\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, any exception thrown during an individual's evaluation will cause `leap.distributed` to deem that individual to be non-viable.  It will see the `is_viable` to `False`, set the fitness to `math.nan`, and set the attribute `exception` to the thrown exception.  This should hopefully make it easier to track such individuals and to provide a diagnostic to how and when individuals are marked non-viable during runs.  `leap.core.context['leap']['distributed']['non_viable']` is incremented to keep a running total of non-viable individuals during a run; you will need to manually reset this counter between runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both `leap.distributed.synchronous` and `leap.distributed.asynchronous` use `leap.distributed.evaluate` to implement this functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `steady_state()` example\n",
    "\n",
    "The following example uses `steady_state()` to do what we did above, though we go with the default inserter, `insert_into_pop()` that is less greedy that what we used earlier.  Note that we didn't specify the `individual_cls` argument since the default already uses `core.Individual`."
