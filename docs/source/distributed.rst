Distributed LEAP
================
LEAP supports synchronous and asynchronous distributed concurrent fitness evaluations that
can significantly speed-up runs.  LEAP uses dask (`https://dask.org/`), which
is a popular distributed processing python package, to implement
parallel fitness evaluations, and which allows easy scaling from laptops to supercomputers.

Synchronous fitness evaluations
-------------------------------
Synchronous fitness evaluations are essentially a map/reduce approach where individuals
are fanned out to computing resources to be concurrently evaluated, and then
the calling process waits until all the evaluations are done.  This is particularly
suited for by-generation approaches where offspring are evaluated in a
batch, and progress in the EA only proceeds when all individuals have been evaluated.

Components
^^^^^^^^^^
`leap_ec.distributed.synchronous` provides two components to implement synchronous
individual parallel evaluations.

:leap_ec.distributed.synchronous.eval_population:
    which evaluates an entire population in parallel, and returns the evaluated population
:leap_ec.distributed.synchronous.eval_pool:
    is a pipeline operator that will collect offspring and then evaluate them all
    at once in parallel; the evaluated offspring are returned

Example
^^^^^^^
The following shows a simple example of how to use the synchronous parallel
fitness evaluation in LEAP.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/simple_sync_distributed.py
    :linenos:
    :language: python
    :lines: 5-42

This example of a basic genetic algorithm that solves the MAX ONES problem
does not use a provided monolithic entry point, such as found with
`ea_solve()` or `generational_ea()` but, instead, directly uses LEAP's pipeline
architecture.  Here, we create a simple `dask` `Client` that uses the default
local cores to do the parallel evaluations.  The first step is to create the
initial random population, and then distribute those to dask workers for evaluation
via `synchronous.eval_population()`, and which returns a set of fully evaluated
parents.  The `for` loop supports the number of generations we want, and provides
a sequence of pipeline operators to create offspring from selected parents.  For
concurrently evaluating newly created offspring, we use `synchronous.eval_pool`,
which is just a variant of the `leap_ec.ops.pool` operator that relies on `dask`
to evaluate individuals in parallel.

.. note:: If you wanted to use resources on a cluster or supercomputer, you would
    start up `dask-scheduler` and `dask-worker`s first, and then point the `Client`
    at the scheduler file used by the scheduler and workers.  Distributed LEAP is agnostic on what kind of dask
    client is passed as a `client` parameter -- it will generically perform the same
    whether running on local cores or on a supercomputer.

Separate Examples
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There is a jupyter notebook that walks through a synchronous implementation in
`examples/simple_sync_distributed.ipynb`.  The above example can also be found
at `examples/simple_sync_distributed.py`.

Asynchronous fitness evaluations
--------------------------------
Asynchronous fitness evaluations are a little more involved in that the EA immediately integrates
newly evaluated individuals into the population -- it doesn't wait until all
the individuals have finished evaluating before proceeding.  More specifically,
LEAP implements an asynchronous steady-state evolutionary algorithm (ASEA).

.. figure:: _static/asea.png

    Algorithm 1: Asynchronous steady-state evolutionary algorithm concurrently
    updates a population as individuals are evaluated.  (:cite:`10.1145/3377929.3398147`)

Algorithm 1 shows the details of how an ASEA works.  Newly evaluated individuals
are inserted into the population, which then leaves a computing resource available.
Offspring are created from one or more selected parents, and are then assigned
to that computing resource, thus assuring minimal idle time between evaluations.
This is particularly important within HPC contexts as it is often the case that
such resources are costly, and therefore there is an implicit need to minimize
wasting such resources.  By contrast, a synchronous distributed approach risks
wasting computing resources because computing resources that finish evaluating
individuals before the last individual is evaluated will idle until the next
generation.

                                          decoder=IdentityDecoder(),
                                          initialize=create_binary_sequence(
                                              GENOME_LENGTH),
                                          individual_cls=DistributedIndividual),

                                      problem=MaxOnes(),

                                      offspring_pipeline=[
                                          ops.random_selection,
                                          ops.clone,
                                              mutate_bitflip,
                                          ops.pool(size=1)],

                                      evaluated_probe=track_workers_func,
                                      pop_probe=track_pop_func)

    print(f'Final pop: \n{pformat(final_pop)}')

The above example is quite different from the synchronous code given earlier.  Unlike,
with the synchronous code, the asynchronous code does provide a monolithic function
entry point, `asynchronous.steady_state()`.  The first thing to note is that
by nature this EA has a birth budget, not a generation budget, and which is set
to 500 in `MAX_BIRTHS`, and passed in via the `births` parameter.  We also need
to know the size of the initial population, which is given in `init_pop_size`.
And, of course, we need the size of the population that is perpetually updated
during the lifetime of the run, and which is passed in via the `pop_size`
parameter.

The `representation` parameter we have seen before in the other monolithic
functions, such as `generational_ea`, which encapsulates the mechanisms for
making an individual and how the individual's state is stored.  In this case,
because it's the MAX ONES problem, we use the `IdentityDecoder` because we want
to use the raw bits as is, and we specify a factory function for creating
binary sequences GENOME_LENGTH in size; and, lastly, we override the default
class with a new class, `DistributedIndividual`, that contains some additional
bookkeeping useful for an ASEA, and is described later.

The `offspring_pipeline` differs from the usual LEAP pipelines.  That is, a
LEAP pipeline is usally a set of operators that define a workflow for creating offspring
from a set of prospective parents.  In this case, the pipeline is for creating a
*single* offspring from an *implied* population of prospective parents to be
evaluated on a recently available dask worker; essentially, as a dask worker
finishes evaluating an individual, this pipeline will be used to create a single
offspring to be assigned to that worker for evaluation.  This gives the user
maximum flexibility in how that offspring is created by choosing a selection
operator followed by perturbation operators deemed suitable for the given problem.
(Not forgetting the critical `clone` operator, the absence of which will cause
selected parents to be modified by any applied mutation or crossover operators.)

There are two optional callback function reporting parameters, `evaluated_probe` and `pop_probe`.
`evaluated_probe` takes a single `Individual` class, or subclass, as an argument,
and can be used to write out that individual's state in a desired format.
`distributed.probe.log_worker_location` can be passed in as this argument to
write each individual's state as a CSV row to a file; by default it will write to
`sys.stdout`.  The `pop_probe` parameter is similar, but allows for taking
snapshots of the hidden population at preset intervals, also in CSV format.

Also noteworthy is that the `Client` has a `scheduler_file` specified, which
indicates that a dask scheduler and one or more dask workers have already been
started beforehand outside of LEAP and are awaiting tasking to evaluate individuals.

There are three other optional parameters to `steady_state`, which are summarized
as follows:

:inserter: takes a callback function of the signature `(individual, population, max_size)`
    where `individual` is the newly evaluated individual that is a candidate for
    inserting into the `population`, and which is the internal population that
    `steady_state` updates. The value for `max_size` is passed in by `steady_state` that is the
    user stipulated population size, and is used to determine if the individual
    should just be inserted into the population when at the start of the run it
    has yet to reach capacity.  That is, when a user invokes `steady_state`,
    they specify a population size via `pop_size`, and we would just normally
    insert individuals until the population reaches `pop_size` in capacity, then
    the function will use criteria to determine whether the individual is worthy
    of being inserted.  (And, if so, at the removal of an individual that was
    already in the population.  Or, colloquially, someone is voted off the island.)

    There are two provided inserters, `steady_state.insert_into_pop` and
    `greedy_insert_into_pop`.  The first will randomly select an individual from
    the internal population, and will replace it if its fitness is worse than
    the new individual.  The second will compare the new individual with the
    current worst in the population, and will replace that individual if it is
    better.  The default for `inserter` is to use the `greedy_insert_into_pop`.

    Of course you can write your own if either of these two inserters do not meet
    your needs.

:count_nonviable: is a boolean that, if True, means that individuals that are
    non- viable are counted towards the birth budget; by default, this is `False`. A
    non-viable individual is one where an exception was thrown during evaluation.
    (E.g., an individual poses a deep-learner configuration that does not make
    sense, such as incompatible adjacent convolutional layers, and pytorch or
    tensorflow throws an exception.)

:context: contains global state where the running number of births and non-viable individuals
    is kept.  This defaults to `context`.

DistributedIndividual
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
`DistributedIndividual` is a subclass of `RobustIndividual` that contains some additional
state that may be useful for distributed fitness evaluations.

:uuid: is UUID assigned to that individual upon creation
:birth_id: is a unique, monotonically increasing integer assigned to each
    indidividual on creation, and denotes its birth order
:start_eval_time: is when evaluation began for this individul, and is in `time_t` format
:stop_eval_time: when evaluation completed in `time_t` format

This additional state is set in `distributed.evaluate.evaluate()` and
`is_viable` and `exception` are set as with the base class, `core.Individual`.

.. note:: The `uuid` is useful if one wanted to save, say, a model or some other
    state in a file; using the `uuid` in the file name will make it easier to associate
    the file with a given individual later during a run's post mortem analysis.

.. note:: The `start_eval_time` and `end_eval_time` can be useful for checking
    whether individuals that take less time to evaluate come to dominate the
    population, which can be important in ASEA parameter tuning.  E.g., initially
    the population will come to be dominated by individuals that evaluated quickly
    even if they represent inferior solutions; however, eventually, better solutions
    that take longer to evaluate will come to dominate the population; so, if
    one observes that shorter solutions still dominate the population, then
    increasing the `max_births` should be considered, if feasible, to allow time
    for solutions that need longer to evaluate time to make a representative
    presence in the population.
