# LEAP
A general purpose Library for Evolutionary Algorithms in Python.
Written by Dr. Jeffrey K. Bassett
Contributors: Dr. Mark Coletti, Eric "Siggy" Scott, Dr. R. Paul Weigand

Much of the library design was inspired by the general description of
Evolutionary Algorithms from Dr. Kenneth A. De Jong's book "Evolutionary
Computation: A Unified Approach".  He was my Ph.D. advisor, so I am quite
familiar with his approach.
