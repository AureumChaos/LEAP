This package contains algorithms for computing statistical properties of landscapes.

Much of the research on landscape features is focused on understanding why some problems
are easy or hard to solve for certain algorithms, or on how we might use statistical features
to train machine learning models to assist in algorithm selection.

For a good survey of the field, look to the following paper:
