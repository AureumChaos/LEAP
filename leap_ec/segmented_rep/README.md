Support for segmented representations

THIS IS A NEW sentence

A "segment" is a fixed-length set of values, and a representation can have a 
statically set number of segments or a variable number.

And example of a segmented representation would include Pitt Approach rule 
systems where each segment maps to a rule.  Another example would be that
each segment corresponds to a deep-learner layer with associated hyper-parameter
values.
