"""Pitt-approach rule systems are one of the two basic approach to evolving rule-based programs 
(alongside Michigan-approach systems).  In Pitt systems, every individual encodes a complete
set of rules for producing an output given a set of inputs.

Evolutionary rule systems (also known as learning classifier systems) are often used to create
controller for agents (i.e. for reinforcement learning problems), or to evolve classifiers for
pattern recognition (i.e. supervised learning).

This module provides a basic Pitt-approach system that uses the `spaces` API from OpenAI Gym to 
define input and output spaces for rule conditions and actions, respectively.

            rules, and `best_score` is the highest match-score found
        
        For example, if we've got the following set of rules:

        >>> rules = [ Rule(conditions=[(0.0, 0.6), (0.0, 0.4)], actions=[0]),
        ...           Rule(conditions=[(0.4, 1.0), (0.6, 1.0)], actions=[1]),
        ...           Rule(conditions=[(0.1, 0.2), (0.8, 1.0)], actions=[1]),
        ...           Rule(conditions=[(0.5, 0.4), (0.6, 1.0)], actions=[0])
        ...         ]
        
        And we build a rule system out of it like so:

        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> from gym import spaces
        >>> input_space = spaces.Box(low=np.array((0, 0)), high=np.array((1.0, 1.0)), dtype=np.float32)
        >>> output_space = spaces.Discrete(2)
        >>> rules = PittRulesExecutable(input_space, output_space, rules,
        ...                             priority_metric=PittRulesExecutable.PriorityMetric.RULE_ORDER)

        Then the match sets for different inputs are computed as follows.

        Here's an input that just matches the 0th rule:

        >>> rules._match_set([0.1, 0.3])
        ([0], ...)

        This one matches two rules:

        >>> rules._match_set([0.5, 1.0])
        ([1, 3], ...)

        Note that the last rule in our example ruleset has a condition of `(low, high) = (0.5, 0.4)`.
        Because `low` > `high`, this is interpreted as matching any value for that input:

        >>> rules._match_set([0.0, 0.9])
        ([3], ...)

        This rule interpreter impelment *partial matching.*  So if no rule
        matches the input, then the rule(s) that come closest to matching
        it are chosen.  Here's one that is almost (but not quite!) matched by
        the 0th rule, so the 0th rule is selected:

class PlotPittRuleProbe:
    """A visualization operator that takes the best individual in the population and plots
    the condition bounds for each rule, i.e. as boxes over the input space.

    :param int num_inputs: the number of inputs in the sensor space
    :param int num_outputs: the number of output actions
    :param (int, int) plot_dimensions: which two dimensions of the input space to visualize along the x and y axes; defaults to the first two dimensions, (0, 1)
    :param ax: the matplotlib axis to plot to; if None (the default), new Axes are created
    :param (float, float) xlim: bounds for the horizontal axis
    :param (float, float) ylim: bounds for the vertical axis
    :param int modulo: the interval (in generations) to go between each visualization; i.e. if set to 10, then the visualization will be updated every 10 generations
    :param context: the context objected that the generation count is read from (should be updated by the algorithm at each generation)

    This probe requires a `decoder`, which it uses to parse individual genomes into sets of rules that it can visualize:

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from gym import spaces
    >>> in_ = spaces.Box(low=np.array((0, 0)), high=np.array((1.0, 1.0)), dtype=np.float32)
    >>> out_ = spaces.Discrete(2)
    >>> decoder = PittRulesDecoder(input_space=in_, output_space=out_)

    Now we can create the probe itself:

    >>> probe = PlotPittRuleProbe(decoder)

    If we feed it a population of a single individual, we'll see all that individual's rules visualized.  Like all LEAP probes, it
    returns the population unmodified.  This allows the probe to be inserted into an EA's operator pipeline.
